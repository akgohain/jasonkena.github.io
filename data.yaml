bio: |
  I am a third-year undergraduate at [Boston College](https://www.bc.edu/) studying Computer Science and Mathematics. I work as a research assistant at [Prof. Donglai Wei's Computer Vision lab](https://donglaiw.github.io/), focusing on the area of [connectomics](https://connectomics.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

  I lead the [BC Machine Intelligence Group](https://github.com/BCMIG) ([club Discord](https://discord.gg/JDEjsEZhNr)), am a member in the [BC Experimental Math and Machine Learning Lab](https://sites.google.com/view/bcexpmmll/home), and compete as part of the BC Competitive Programming Team.

  Previously, I held a research internship at [EPFL's CVLab](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/cvlab/) where I had the privilege of being mentored by [Dr. Jiancheng Yang](https://jiancheng-yang.com/) and [Prof. Pascal Fua](https://people.epfl.ch/pascal.fua/bio). Additionally, I interned at [Emmerich Research Center](https://www.research.emmerich.co.id/) under [Dr. Eden Steven](https://www.research.emmerich.co.id/eden-steven).
  
# My research interests lie in 3D instance segmentation, biomedical image analysis, and unsupervised learning.
